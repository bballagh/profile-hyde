Hi! Thanks for visiting my professional website. My name is Brooke Ballagh and I am a [Journalism and Mass Communication](http://clas.uiowa.edu/sjmc/) major at [The University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu).

Through the many journalism courses I have taken, I have discovered my passion of producing broadcast television. I hope to one day be a producer at a local TV station. Currently I am a producer at [Daily Iowan TV](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheDailyIowan). Through working at Daily Iowan TV, I have been able to learn about the world broadcast news and develop my skills as a broadcast news producer.
