Hi! Thanks for visiting my professional website. My name is Brooke Ballagh and I am a [Journalism and Mass Communication](http://clas.uiowa.edu/sjmc/) major at [The University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu).

Through the many journalism courses I have taken, I have discovered my passion of producing broadcast television. My dream is to be a producer at a TV station in Chicago where I would deliver fair and honest news to TV viewers. I consider myself an organized, kind, and up-to-date person who wants to inform people about what is happening in the world. 

Thanks for taking the time to explore my website.
