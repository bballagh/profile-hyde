Hi! Thanks for visiting my professional website. My name is Brooke Ballagh and I am a  [School of Journalism and Mass Communication](http://clas.uiowa.edu/sjmc/) major at [The University of Iowa] (https://uiowa.edu).

Through the many journalism courses I have taken, I have discovered my passion of producing broadcast television. I hope to one day be a producer at a local TV station. Currently I am a producer at [Daily Iowan TV] (https://www.youtube.com/user/TheDailyIowan) and it is at Daily Iowan TV where I have learned about the world of producing.
